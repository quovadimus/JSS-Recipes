JSS-Recipes
===========


Not yet ready for primetime recipes are listed under [Test](https://github.com/quovadimus/Test-Recipes).


JSS recipes are based upon those written by Shea Craig, built for use with the [jss-autopkg-addon](https://github.com/sheagcraig/jss-autopkg-addon/releases).

Custom recipes were made through the use of either [Recipe Robot](https://github.com/homebysix/recipe-robot) or a sophisicated system of trial & error, sometimes referred to as guessing.

Parent recipes come from the following repos, add them all with autopkg repo-add

*  https://github.com/autopkg/recipes<br>
*  https://github.com/autopkg/nmcspadden-recipes<br>
